# challenge-app

Sample challenge app built using most recent official libraries (2020):

- Hilt (Dependency injection)
- Paging Library 3
- Commonly used components such as Retrofit (REST client) & Room (Database solution)
- Navigation from Jetpack
- Coil for lazy image loading (library written in Kotlin)
- Sectioned RecyclerView lightweight & simple library (https://github.com/crux-lab/sectioned-recycler-view) which adds support for sections and sticky headers but still allows to extend functionality with ease due to compatibility with existing API
